### Hello there!
Right now you search repo which contains source code of mine self-created portfolio webpage. Want to see it in action? Just click [the link](https://inver-portfolio.netlify.app)

### Purpose
The page contains basic information about user, skills that are stored for easier read in graph viewer and short biography. The webpage intoduces me, and even the source code of it is a good example of some my front-end developer skills.


### Technologies
As front-end framework  I have used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), a React-based static site generator.  Basically portfolio was my first project I created with it and it's kinda awesome to use. Also I needed a CMS. I used headless one - [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com). It's easy to use, powerful, free and proviedes GraphQL API. The CI/CD process is controller by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) which subscribes git repo and when changes are made builds project and deploys it as one of hosted by at https://inver-portfolio.netlify.com
